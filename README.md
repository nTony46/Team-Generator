# Team-Generator
Hello, I'm Tony and this is a console app that I made while learning C# and Git. 

## How to use
A simple way to use this is to copy-paste the code into an regular C# IDE, or an online IDE like Repl.it.
It should be fairly simple to use â€” just plug and play. Run the program and it will prompt you to enter the number of players, 
teams, and list the names. Then the console app will return the players distributed randomly amongst teams.
